--These mods will only be used for scoring really large numbers
--I don't know if there will be any problems since it's totally fine from my side. 

--I should also remind you that everything made is inspired by ExpantaNum.js by Naruyoko, but is completely different from copying it. 
--No plagiarism at all, this is free to use and edit, do anything you want. 
--If there are problems, fix them yourself. I still have ideas for score limits. 


-- Inside of this repository are also Joker Ideas, Joker Rarities and Consumable Ideas. 

-- I'll list down whatever I think of since they're gonna disappear from my mind in no time. 



-Jokers-
Illinois Destroyer
Exotic.
Will give ^2 mult, increase by 0.01 for every click registered. 
"Nonsensical, isn't it?" 

Honorificabilitudinity
Common.
6x mult, 5 in 250 chance for extinction. 
"Cavendish's Older Brother. He expires earlier though." 

Thine Existence Be Vanquished! 
Alternate Universal. 
Will give e2#250 mult, increase by {1} for every other joker below this rarity. 
"So here we are, the final boss."
Eternal upon purchase. 
Absolute upon purchase. 

Thy Vicinity See His Work! 
Superior
Will give ee2###5738 mult, increase by [0 0 0 0, 1 1 1, 2 2 2 2, 3 3, 4 4 4 4, 5 5 5 5] for every joker destroyed or sold. 
"You are too overpowered now, here's the more inferior one though." 
Absolute upon Purchase. 

Balatro's Code
--------------
So unbelievably rare that it doesn't have a name
Will give Infinity Mult (real infinity, in the case that your cap is essentially infinite) 
" Welcome, the king is in town. Take a seat, for he will respect your every decision." 
Cannot be sold even if you code it to be sold. 

Pablo
Common
He spins, like Maxwell. 
Gives 5x mult, flat. 
"he's missing juan 😞" 

Juan
Common
The horse. 
Gives 5x chips, flat. 
"he misses pablo 😞" 

Juan and Pablo
Legendary 
Combine Juan and Pablo
Gives 10x chips and 10x mult, flat. 
"yay, the duo is back in town! 👍" 

Job Application 
Exotic
"yea."

-Rarity-
Unrealistic
Literally so bad that it's scaling in the negatives. 

Alternative Universe
(renamed) This is so overpowered that you literally cannot find this in Balanced Deck nor in any packs. 

Decommissioned
Downgraded version of an already pre-existing joker, will give 25% of what was downgraded. 

Excel
A parody of Exotic but it's slightly worse.

-Consumables-

Middle Finger
Will give ANY card of your choice (excluding anything beyond Amalgamation in Almanac) and is a one-time use. If used, this card will no longer exist in your run. 

The Entire Fucking Body
A remix of Middle Finger but it can even modify your stakes, your selected card sleeve, and even the rarity of jokers (only in the run in which you have it)  

Senate Committee
A remix of Pointer but with a 50% chance of granting your choice. 

Generational Debt
Puts your money to shame and modifies it to be "-1e720472" with no way to recover. Cannot be reverted by Wraith or any other Spectral. Is eternal upon acquiring. Literally cannot be sold. 

Instant Win
This is a JJT reference. It is what it says, you instantly win the game. Not a boss blind or a small/big blind, you win the game no matter what. 

The Final Difficulty
Another JJT reference. This will reset your entire run to ante 1 and will apply itself as a stake.

Event in the case that it's beaten
"How? I made everything in a way that there is no theological way of computing numbers enough to beat the final ante! Even every card had no value, all cards were literally a futile effort! Anyhow, the universe must have fucking exploded from the sheer difficulty of beating the trilogy. The fourth rendition is in progress but I'll guarantee that it is much, exponentially harder than The Trilogy. See you in Treachery!"
All decks will now have The Final Stake as a stake higher than Ascendant, even The Final Deck. 

Your player stats are now corrupted but this is such an amazing achievement that it's worth the corrupted data.
