--These mods will only be used for scoring really large numbers
--I don't know if there will be any problems since it's totally fine from my side. 

--I should also remind you that everything made is inspired by ExpantaNum.js by Naruyoko, but is completely different from copying it. 
--No plagiarism at all, this is free to use and edit, do anything you want. 
--If there are problems, fix them yourself. I still have ideas for score limits.
